== General overview

The 42ITy™ project promotes the global development, distribution and
adoption of the 42ITy™ platform as a next generation Data Center Service
Optimization enablement platform.

The goal is to serve developers, users and the entire data center ecosystem
by providing a set of shared resources to grow the adoption of 42ITy™ as
the only open source, next generation Data Center Service Optimization
enablement platform.

The initial 42ITy™ platform is a result of more than 3 years of R&D effort
by Eaton Corporation provided to the community.  While Eaton continues to
be a key contributor to 42ITy™, the community is already growing.  Please
read the link:contributing.html[Contributor guide] to find out how you can
contribute.

The 42ITy™ platform allows to connect together various software components to:

* gather and store monitoring data from devices,
* process these data to produce trends and metrics,
* provide interaction to users, through a web user interface,
* provide interaction to developers and 3rd party software, through a REST API.

A typical integration, which serves as a reference implementation, is

== Technical overview

The 42ITy™ software platform is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), made of a
collection of software packages communicating through a MOM (Message-oriented
middleware), built around the link:http://zeromq.org[ZeroMQ] technology stack.

The software is divided in a set of independent components, called *agent*.

image:images/42ITy-SW-arch.png[42ITy SW architecture]

Because we expect an arbitrary number of agents to be connected together, 42ITy™
uses a central message broker called Malamute.

Malamute is built using the same ZeroMQ stack, so integrates with the code
easily. The purpose of malamute is to abstract from maintaining peer-to-peer
connections and to allow easy 1:N communication patterns without need to change
the agent side.

At the moment there are three main patterns supported by Malamute broker:

* PUB / SUB, Publish and Subscribe:
there are agents publishing messages with some topic, where others can subscribe
to them. Broker then ensures all messages are delivered to the right destination.
Communication is asynchronous - each PUB call is queued immediately and sending
does not block the code.

* REQ / REP, Request and Reply:
this is a directed 1:1 communication, usable for requesting some information
from known place (persistence layer). It is synchronous, so blocking calling
code until there is a result (or timeout).

* Service:
service is a dedicated agent, which can run in more instances spawned by broker
on demand. This is suitable for long running tasks. This is not used in 42ITy™
currently.

=== MQ protocol overview

42ITy protocol consists of several layers:

* Internet layer - raw libzmq/czmq sockets: this ensures messages are
serialized, deserialized, working with sockets and abstracts the underlying OS
layers (unix sockets, tcp sockets, ...).
* Transport layer - Malamute: this does ensures correct addressing, matching
subscribers with published messages and services.
* Application layer - 42ity-proto: this provides a minimal set of messages to
encode and decode the main types of data flowing in the system.

=== Agent overview

Agents communicate through buses maintained by ZeroMQ library. Buses can use
several backend technologies, most notably unix and classic TCP/IP sockets. So
agents can be placed on the same machine or on arbitrary number of other
machines (currently out of scope). Because basic messaging using zeromq messages
(zmsg) is error prone with a lot of code duplication, 42ITy™ project uses
serialization library called zproto. It defines a model of message in
declarative XML language and code is generated using a template language called
gsl.

Generated code does provide nice C API for manipulating with messages as well as
a way how to encode/decode it to/from zmsg. Thus such generated representations
can be easily sent through zeromq channels.

==== Actor model

Agents are built on top of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model[actor model].
That means each maintains own state internally and communicate with the rest of
the system over sending messages. The communication is asynchronous and agents
are single threaded with the main loop. For cases the single main loop is not
enough due performance reasons, agent can distribute workload to others using
SERVICE pattern. However this is not used in current version of BIOS.

=== REST API communication interface

42ITy™ also exposes its data through a REST API.

Complete documentation using RAML is available:

* link:doc/rest/42ity_rest_api.html[HTML format]

=== 42ITy™ external projects

42ITy™ foundations rely on several major opensource projects, to provide some
generic core services, such as data storage, communication with devices,
communication between agents, web user interface and REST API, and build added
value on top of these.

==== Malamute

link:https://github.com/zeromq/malamute[Malamute] is the ZeroMQ Enterprise
Messaging Broker, providing all the enterprise messaging patterns in one box.

42ITy™ uses Malamute as the broker connecting the different 42ITy™ agents (see
internal sub-projects).

==== MariaDB - MySQL

link:https://mariadb.org[MariaDB] is one of the most popular database servers in
the world, made by the original developers of link:http://www.mysql.com[MySQL]
and guaranteed to stay open source.

42ITy™ uses MariaDB to store the realtime data, gathered from devices, and
processed metrics.

==== NUT - Network UPS Tools

link:http://networkupstools.org[NUT - Network UPS Tools] is a project which
provides support for a wide range of power devices, such as UPS, PDU and ATS.

42ITy™ uses to gather data from network power devices.

==== Tntnet

link:http://www.tntnet.org/[Tntnet] is a modular, multithreaded web application
server for C++.

42ITy™ uses Tntnet to serve web user interface and REST API.

=== Services dependencies

The systemd system and service manager is responsible for controlling how 42ITy™
services are started, stopped and otherwise managed. It uses an event-based and
dependencies based approach to optimize how services are managed (started,
stopped, reloaded).

The figure bellow illustrates the dependencies relationships for services
running on 42ITy™.
