= Welcome to 42ITy!

== Our mission

The 42ITY(TM) project exists to provide the most open, flexible platform in the
industry for enabling data center service optimization.

Proprietary, monolithic solutions for data center infrastructure management have
often failed to provide the expected customer value because they are too costly
to integrate & deploy in heterogeneous data center environments.

42ITy(TM) addresses these issues by providing an intuitive data center monitoring
platform based on a modern micro-services architecture with open REST APIs,
facilitating integration with existing solutions. And best of all, it is open
source! This enables data center operators and data center ecosystem solution
partners to provide a seamless monitoring experience even in the most
heterogeneous environments via a common framework and APIs.
