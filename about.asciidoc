== About

The 42ITY(TM) project promotes the global development, distribution and
adoption of the 42ITY(TM) platform as a next generation Data Center Service
Optimization enablement platform.

The goal is to serve developers, users and the entire data center ecosystem
by providing a set of shared resources to grow the adoption of 42ITy(TM) as
the only open source, next generation Data Center Service Optimization
enablement platform.

The initial 42ITY(TM) platform is a result of more than 3 years of R&D effort
by Eaton Corporation provided to the community.  While Eaton continues to
be a key contributor to 42ITy(TM), the community is already growing. Please
read the link:contributing.html[Contributor guide] to find out how you can
contribute.
