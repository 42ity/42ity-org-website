== About

The 42ITY™ project promotes the global development, distribution and
adoption of the 42ITY™ platform as a next generation Data Center Service
Optimization enablement platform.

The goal is to serve developers, users and the entire data center ecosystem
by providing a set of shared resources to grow the adoption of 42ITy™ as
the only open source, next generation Data Center Service Optimization
enablement platform.

The initial 42ITY™ platform is a result of more than 3 years of R&D effort
by Eaton Corporation provided to the community.  While Eaton continues to
be a key contributor to 42ITy, the community is already growing.  Please
